<h1 align="center">Repository Settings Guidelines</h1>

This guideline outlines the recommended settings for your repository, using my project [River-Charts](https://github.com/scottgriv/River-Charts) as a practical example:
- To adjust your repository settings, click on the gear icon located next to the "About" section in the top right corner of your repository's main page.

## Project Name

Consult the [Category Guidelines](./category_guidelines.md) to determine how to name your project.

## Description

> [!WARNING]
> **REQUIRED** file for **ALL** tiers.

Use a description that is short and to the point. This is the first thing people will see when they visit your repository. Make it count!
- i.e. "A Python, Django, Plotly, and Pandas web application that visualizes river data pulled using an API from the United States Geological Survey (USGS)."

## Website

> [!WARNING]
> **OPTIONAL** file for **ALL** tiers.
> Strongly encouraged if you're able to host a static website to demonstrate your project.
> Link the website to the `banner_large.png` file if it is for a **Gold** tier project.
> Link the website to the `banner_small.png` file if it is for a **Silver** or **Bronze** tier project.

## Topics

> [!WARNING]

- Fill out as many topics as you can, but don't overdo it - these are used for search results in GitHub so it will help people find your project.
- Topics should highlight the main technologies, frameworks, and languages used in the project.
    - i.e. visualization, python, api, charts, data, django, plotly, pandas, data-visualization, dataset, webapp, data-analysis, usgs, usgs-api

## Misc. Settinges

- Releases, Packages, Deployments should only be checked under "Include in the home page" if you're using those features.
- I strongly recommend using Releases for **Gold** projects.
- Make sure you Pin your project to your profile if you want it to show up on your profile page. 
    - **Gold** projects should always be pinned to your profile.
- `README` files should always be included in your repository.
    - View [Repository Structure Guidelines](./repository_structure_guidelines.md) and [README Guidelines](./readme_guidelines.md) for more information on how to setup your project structure and `README` file.
