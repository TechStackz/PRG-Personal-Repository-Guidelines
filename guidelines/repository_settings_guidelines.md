## Repository Settings (All Tiers):
I will be using my project [River-Charts](https://github.com/scottgriv/River-Charts) as an example for the following guideline:
- Click the gear icon next to "About" in the upper right corner of your repository to access the repository settings.

### Description (Required)
- A description is **always** required.
    - i.e. "A Python, Django, Plotly, and Pandas web application that visualizes river data pulled using an API from the United States Geological Survey (USGS)."

### Website (Optional)
- A website is **not** required, but strongly encouraged if you're able to host a website for your project.
    - i.e. http://scottgriv.pythonanywhere.com/
    - [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) is a great free option for hosting static websites for your project.

### Topics (Required)
- A list of topics are **always** required.
- Fill out as many topics as you can, but don't overdo it.
- Topics should highlight the main technologies, frameworks, and languages used in the project.
    - i.e. visualization, python, api, charts, data, django, plotly, pandas, data-visualization, dataset, webapp, data-analysis, usgs, usgs-api

### Misc. Settings (Optional)
- Releases, Packages, Deployments should only be checked under "Include in the home page" if you're using those features.
- I strongly recommend using Releases for **Gold** projects.
- Make sure you Pin your project to your profile if you want it to show up on your profile page. **Gold** projects should always be pinned to your profile.
- A Profile `README` is always required. Read more about it [here](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/customizing-your-profile/managing-your-profile-readme).
