## Repository Settings
I will be using my project [River-Charts](https://github.com/scottgriv/River-Charts) as an example for the following guideline:
- Click the gear icon next to "About" in the upper right corner of your repository to access the repository settings.

### Description
> [!WARNING]
> **REQUIRED** file for **ALL** tiers.

Use a description that is short and to the point. This is the first thing people will see when they visit your repository. Make it count!
- i.e. "A Python, Django, Plotly, and Pandas web application that visualizes river data pulled using an API from the United States Geological Survey (USGS)."

### Website
> [!WARNING]
> **OPTIONAL** file for **ALL** tiers.
> Strongly encouraged if you're able to host a static website to demonstrate your project.
> Link the website to the `banner_large.png` file if it is for a **Gold** tier project.
> Link the website to the `banner_small.png` file if it is for a **Silver** or **Bronze** tier project.

- [PythonAnywhere](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/) is a great free option for hosting Python web applications.
    - i.e. http://scottgriv.pythonanywhere.com/
- [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) is a great free option for hosting static websites for your project.
    - [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) is a great static site generator that is built into GitHub Pages.
- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) is a great free option for hosting static websites for your project.
    - [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) is a great static site generator that is built into Netlify.
    - [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) is a great static site generator that is built into Netlify.

### Topics
> [!WARNING]
> **REQUIRED** file for **ALL** tiers.

- Fill out as many topics as you can, but don't overdo it - these are used for search results in GitHub so it will help people find your project.
- Topics should highlight the main technologies, frameworks, and languages used in the project.
    - i.e. visualization, python, api, charts, data, django, plotly, pandas, data-visualization, dataset, webapp, data-analysis, usgs, usgs-api

### Misc. Settinges
- Releases, Packages, Deployments should only be checked under "Include in the home page" if you're using those features.
- I strongly recommend using Releases for **Gold** projects.
- Make sure you Pin your project to your profile if you want it to show up on your profile page. 
    - **Gold** projects should always be pinned to your profile.
- `README` files should always be included in your repository.
    - View [Repository Structure Guidelines](./repository_structure_guidelines.md) and [README Guidelines](./readme_guidelines.md) for more information on how to setup your project structure and `README` file.
